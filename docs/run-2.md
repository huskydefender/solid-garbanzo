# Progress Log

## 2026-01-05
### Notable Encounters
- No Jellicent this time, Staryu and Bruxish instead. I don't think I've ever made it past Sabrina with no Jellicent.

### Notable Fights
#### Surge
| **Mine**     | **Counters**                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Arcanine - H | Vikavolt                              |
| Clodsire     | Bellibolt & Toxic Spikes              |
| Donphan      | Manectric                             |
| Rapidash - G | Pawmot                                |
| Heliolisk    | Bonus, to bait Mud Shot from Vikavolt |
| Meganium     | Bellibolt/Pawmot/Pivot                |

- Nothing really to this one. Surge is super switch happy, but these mons wall him pretty hard. Vikavolt is really the only tricky one becauses of Levitate and the coverage. Lucked into an Hisuian Arcanine this run though, which makes it free with an Air Balloon.

- Not as clean as I'd like. Got a random Mud Shot on Meganium for some reason, maybe priority for Speed Control?

#### Erika
| **Mine**    | **Counters**  |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| Swellow     | Venusaur      |
| Golisopod   | Rillaboom     |
| Slowbro - G | Meganium      |
| Incineroar  | Meowscarada   |
| Palossand   | Electrode - H |
| Perrserker  | Venusaur      |

- That worked pretty well. Erika is also pretty switch happy. I thought about setting Swellow up with an Agility on Rillaboom to try to sweep, but it doesn't have the juice. So I went Aerialate/Return rather than Guts/Facade. 
- Closest call was Swellow and Venusaur. Sludge Bomb brought me down to 12. Would have been fine as long as it didn't crit. I got it in on Golisopod Emergency Exit. First Return hit about 70%. It really should have done more, I'm not 100% sure what happened there.

### Things I learned
- Got lucky with the crits on Venusaur. 
- Regenerator on Slowbro - G is *great*.
- On to the Hypno Double!
