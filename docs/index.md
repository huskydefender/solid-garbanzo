# Overview
This is a quick space for me to document some of my journey with Radical Red. Updates will be ad hoc as I get time or the inclination. I'm also not terribly good at the game, so there'll be lots of learning as I go. Mostly this will just help me track when and how I wipe to try to keep from doing the same thing twice.
