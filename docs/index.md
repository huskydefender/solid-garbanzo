This is a quick space for me to document some of my journey with Radical Red. Updates will be ad hoc as I get time or the inclination. I'm also not terribly good at the game, so there'll be lots of learning as I go. Mostly this will just help me track when and how I wipe to try to keep from doing the same thing twice.

## Notes

I've been working on a Nuzlocke of this game for a good long time now, so I do a few things to keep myself sane.

1. All cheat codes on. I'm trying to get better at the battle strategy part, not the catching/grinding part. Maybe one day I'll turn off EZCatch, but not today.
2. Unless I'm feeling like running a new starter (I usually run Chikorita), I save state in Celadon after beating Misty and Bugsy but only have encounters up to Pewter City. This is mainly because I still haven't beaten it, and I don't want to reset because I do something stupid in Mt. Moon. Here's the list of encounters I start with:

| **Location**     | **Encounter**   |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| Starter          | Chikorita       |
| Route 21         | Wooper - H      |
| Pallet Town      | Larvesta*       |
| Route 1          | Meowth - G      |
| Viridian City    | Marill          |
| Route 22         | Sandyghast      |
| Route 2          | Ponyta - G      |
| Viridian Forest  | Pikachu         |
| Pewter City      | Phanpy          |
| SS Anne          | Golisopod       |

Yes. I did originally make sure that I could get to Celadon with just these encounters. Once I'm able to beat this, maybe I'll go back and do a run from the beginning, but I'm an adult doing this for fun. I'd rather play other parts of the game.
