# Overview
Finished - 2026-01-04
This isn't really my first run, just the first one I'm tracking this way. 

# Outcome - Lost at Gio 3
This was a randomized run, but by far my best yet and should have made E4. 
There were a huge number of great mons, but the highlights were a Parental Bond/Speed Boost Mewtwo, and
a Fur Coat Kyurem. I also had a Moxie Giratina. The only killer for this run was Lance. 

# Analysis
Apparently Lance doesn't see your ability in randomizers. I led with a Pixilate Tornadus that had the OHKO on Scrafty. 
I expected Dragapult to hit Tapu Lele with Spirit Shackle, then get KO'd, but instead he hit Scrafty with Dragon Darts. 

Dragon Darts. 

Anyway, this completely threw me off, because it meant that Lele killed Dragapult for free. That would have been fine,
but I was hoping Lance would bring in Dialga and kill the Lele next turn. I would have U-turned out after baiting Thunderbolt from Lele.

# Next
I don't think I'll do a randomized run for a while. If I cant beat this with a Parental Bond Mewtwo early on (Route 5 I think), I need some practice. 

I'll go back to standard runs for a while. 

Also, I shouldn't calc/run these fights late at night.
