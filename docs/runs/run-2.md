## Progress Log

### 2026-01-11
#### Notable Encounters
- Rotom

#### Silph Co Rival

| **Mine**     | **Counters**        |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| Krookodile   | Kingambit           |
| Donphan      | Jumpluff            |
| Arcanine - H | Staraptor/Charizard |
| Politoed     | Charizard/Weather   |
| Typhlosion   | Kingambit           |
| Meganium     | Azumarill           |

Wiped. He swapped around quite a bit, and I couldn't predict the Charizard properly. Lost Meganium to an Air Slash that I thought would be a Focus Blast on Donphan. Also realized I forgot to teach Meganium Giga Drain, which affected the Azumarill match up. We'll see how long it takes before I try this again. 

### 2026-01-10
#### Angry Ghost
Handled it with Donphan/Knock Off, Gyarados, and Feraligatr. Gyarados would have done it, but got burned on the switch by Fire Punch. Feraligatr is a tank though and handled two Thunder Punches (with a Wacan Berry) and a Fire Punch.

### 2026-01-09
#### Notable Encounters

- None
  
#### Rocket Hideout Double 2

- Easiest sweep of this. Solo'd with Starmie and Perrserker. Not even worth discussing.

#### Rocket Hideout Double 3
- Probably one of my easiest runs of this too. Led with Raichu and Incineroar. Fake Out and kill Talonflame with Volt Switch.
- Then just pivoted around and Faked Out and soaked damage/Thunderbolts with Clodsire.

#### Gio 1
| **Mine**    | **Role**            |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| Starmie     | Nidoking            |
| Raichu      | Honchkrow           |
| Marowak - A | Kangaskhan/Orthworm |
| Golisopod   | Veluza              |
| Azumarill   | Infernape           |
| Falinks     | Kangaskhan          |

- Really screwed the pooch on this one. Misjudged a roll on Orthworm and let Infernape get behind a sub. My plan for Infernape was Azumarill, but I swapped in on a Pyro Ball and got burned. I'd have been fine if I had a Rawst berry. Then Aqua Tail + Aqua Jet didn't kill and it SD'd. I thought it'd go for Close Combat because I had a Wacan berry, but it went for Thunder Punch and killed Golisopod on the switch in. Then I went to Starmie, and swapped to Raichu to get a Fake Out/Thunderclap. For some reason, it hit a Close Combat instead of Thunder Punch and Raichu died.
- Raichu isn't such a bad loss because I have a lot of Fake Out mons and Heliolisk to be a fast Electric type. However, Golisopod is a big loss. I do have Falinks for First Impression, but it's still rough.

Anyways. On to the Angry Ghost. Plan is for Donphan/Sturdy Knock Off -> Gyarados with Aqua Fang/Intimidate. It's worked before.

### 2026-01-07
#### Notable Encounters
- Sizzlipede - Sevii (Rocket Hideout)
#### Rocket Hideout Double 1

| **Mine**    | **Role**                    |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| Incineroar  | Hypno/Fake Out              |
| Raichu      | Aerodactyl                  |
| Slowbro - G | Granbull                    |
| Golisopod   | Obstagoon                   |
| Granbull    | Obstagoon/Granbull/Typing   |
| Meganium    | Typing/Triage/Fighting/Dark |

#### Things I learned
- I consistently don't plan this fight well. I always seem to underestimate the Obstagoon.
- I lost Granbull to a Facade, although even if I didn't, the Granbull would have doubled it.
- Pivoting around in this fight is just asking for it. I did handle the Dark Void/Unnerve appropriately, and still wasn't paying attention to the Obstagoon STAB/Guts Facade. Not sure why I don't bring a Ghost to handle these. This is not one of those fights to rush the prep on, really need to think it through. I think I'm done for today.



### 2026-01-05
####  Notable Encounters
- No Jellicent this time, Staryu and Bruxish instead. I don't think I've ever made it past Sabrina with no Jellicent.

#### Notable Fights
##### Surge

| **Mine**     | **Counters**                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Arcanine - H | Vikavolt                              |
| Clodsire     | Bellibolt & Toxic Spikes              |
| Donphan      | Manectric                             |
| Rapidash - G | Pawmot                                |
| Heliolisk    | Bonus, to bait Mud Shot from Vikavolt |
| Meganium     | Bellibolt/Pawmot/Pivot                |

- Nothing really to this one. Surge is super switch happy, but these mons wall him pretty hard. Vikavolt is really the only tricky one becauses of Levitate and the coverage. Lucked into an Hisuian Arcanine this run though, which makes it free with an Air Balloon.

- Not as clean as I'd like. Got a random Mud Shot on Meganium for some reason, maybe priority for Speed Control?

##### Erika

| **Mine**    | **Counters**  |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| Swellow     | Venusaur      |
| Golisopod   | Rillaboom     |
| Slowbro - G | Meganium      |
| Incineroar  | Meowscarada   |
| Palossand   | Electrode - H |
| Perrserker  | Venusaur      |

- That worked pretty well. Erika is also pretty switch happy. I thought about setting Swellow up with an Agility on Rillaboom to try to sweep, but it doesn't have the juice. So I went Aerialate/Return rather than Guts/Facade. 
- Closest call was Swellow and Venusaur. Sludge Bomb brought me down to 12. Would have been fine as long as it didn't crit. I got it in on Golisopod Emergency Exit. First Return hit about 70%. It really should have done more, I'm not 100% sure what happened there.

#### Things I learned
- Got lucky with the crits on Venusaur. 
- Regenerator on Slowbro - G is *great*.
- On to the Hypno Double!
