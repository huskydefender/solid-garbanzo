## Progress Log

### 2026-01-20
#### Notable Encounters
##### Pre-Surge
- Just hatched eggs:
  - Espathra, Bouffalant, and Slowpoke - G
  - Learned I don't need them!
##### Pre-Erika
- Vulpix-Alola on Route 5, big win.
- Chespin from an egg on Route 9! Let's go!
- Frillish in Vermillion!

#### Notable Fights

##### Surge
| **Mine**     |     **Counters**     |
| ------------ | :------------------: |
| Clodsire     | Pincurchin/Bellibolt |
| Rapidash - G |   Pawmot/Vikavolt    |
| Donphan      |      Manectric       |
| Meganium     |        Pawmot        |
| Bouffalant   |       Vikavolt       |
| Golisopod    |        Pivot         |

- This was the cleanest Surge I've ever had. Clodsire, Rapidash, Donphan, and Meganium just completely bossed it. Toxic Spikes, then pivot. Vikavolt was the only real stumbling block, but because Rapidash had an Air Balloon and Clodsire was low enough to be knocked out by Mud Shot, it was trivial to pivot to Rapidash and hit two Fire Lashes to KO.
- Manectric was another easy pivot, between Clodsire, Rapidash and Meganium to soak hits and it went down to poison.
- Pawmot came in on Meganium and got 2KO'd by Draining Kiss
- Encounter time!
- Ready to fight Erika


#### Things I learned
- Surge is free, can handle it before getting the rest of my encounters. Just need: Clodsire, Donphan, Rapidash-G, and Meganium.

### 2026-01-21
#### Notable Fights
##### Erika
| **Mine**     | **Counters**  |
| ------------ | :-----------: |
| Swellow      |   Meganium    |
| Rapidash - G | Grass Resist  |
| Palossand    | Electrode - H |
| Espathra     |   Venusaur    |
| Perrserker   |  Meowscarada  |
| Golisopod    |   Rillaboom   |

- What a disappointment. I didn't calc and Espathra Psychic didn't take out Venusaur. On top of that, it lived a second Psychic on 1 after a Giga Drain. That meant I lost Espathra, and somehow Electrode's Chloroblast killed Golisopod. Really should calc these. I don't know Erika's calcs well enough. 
- I used to be able to bait Electrode, then pivot in to Palossand on Explosion, but I will probably re-think that strategy for future runs. It's just so useless other than pivoting around Electrode. 
- Perrserker is a great Meowscarada counter. Lives two Knock-Offs and kills with Fake Out into Iron Head with Steely Spirit. Even if it doesn't, I kill with Bullet Punch.
- Honestly thinking about resetting after this. Golisopod is just so good. But we carry on.

##### Casino Grunt
| **Mine**    |    **Counters**     |
| ----------- | :-----------------: |
| Basculegion |  Hypno/Aerodactyl   |
| Perrserker  | Aerodactyl/Granbull |
| Electivire  |      Obstagoon      |
| Swellow     |      Granbull       |
| Jellicent   |        Pivot        |
| Rhydon      |        Pivot        |

- A very clean fight. Aqua Jet and Bullet Punch for Aerodactyl, then Basulegion takes out Hypno with Phantom Force (thought it was Spirit Shackle, but it worked out fine). It actually worked better than fine, because I brought in Electivire while Obstagoon Sucker Punched Basculegion on the Phantom Force, and then Granbull came out alone, but couldn't beat Electivire and Perrserker through Fake Out and Bullet Punch.

##### First Rocket Double
| **Mine**      |   **Counters**   |
| ------------- | :--------------: |
| Slowbro - G   |   Weezing - G    |
| Perrserker    | Fake Out/Slaking |
| Electivire    |  Crobat/Slaking  |
| Revavroom     |    Hydrapple     |
| Ninetales - A |    Hydrapple     |
| Basculegion   |      Pivot       |

- My messiest one in a while, but no losses. Slowbro - G doesn't get Protect? And forgot to teach it to my back up mons. Took out Weezing first turn as planned, but had to do a bunch of pivoting because Slowbro didn't have Protect. Thank goodness for Revavroom defense and Basculegion typing.

##### Second Rocket Double
##### Casino Grunt
| **Mine**     |       **Counters**       |
| ------------ | :----------------------: |
| Swellow      |    Shiftry/Toxicroak     |
| Raichu       | Talonflame/Lightning Rod |
| Clodsire     |        Eelektross        |
| Slowbro - G  |        Eelektross        |
| Jellicent    |          Pivot           |
| Rapidash - G |          Pivot           |

- My cleanest ever. Lightning Rod Raichu next to Swellow completely breaks this fight. Swellow takes out Shiftry with Dual Wingbeat while Talonflame is flinched with Fake Out. Then Swellow can take out Talonflame if Eelektross comes in, and on the following turn the Toxicroak. By this point, Eelektross has got a few hits in, so I swap to Slowbro and Clodsire to mop up. 
  
#### Things I learned
- Lightning Rod Raichu is great next to Swellow
- I need to calc Erika every time. Can't rely on Palossand for Electrode. 
- Next up Gio 1. I'll take a quick peruse and see if I can find a clean line, but it won't happen today.

#### Post Script
##### Giovanni 1
| **Mine**      |   **Counters**   |
| ------------- | :--------------: |
| Ninetails - A |     Nidoking     |
| Raichu        | Veluza/Honchkrow |
| Fearow        |    Infernape     |
| Cinderace     |     Orthworm     |
| Basculegion   |      Pivot       |
| Chesnaught    |    Kangaskhan    |

- This came together pretty quick and easy, so I ran it. Ninetails OKHO'd Nidoking with Blizzard, then Infernape came in. Hard swap to Fearow (risking a crit), but it paid off and got the KO with Dual Wingbeat. Orthworm came in, and I swapped to Basculegion on the Body press. Got some chip before the Shed Tail, then broke Kangaskhan's substitute with Flip Turn. Handled Kanga by swapping between Basculegion and Chesnaught, then Honchkrow came in on Chesnaught. Swapped to Raichu and took it out with Thunderbolt. Veluza came out and I had to do some more pivoting before taking it out with a Thunderbolt. Then it was just Orthworm, and a final Thunderbolt took it out.

#### Things I learned (again)
- Chesnaught is the best counter for Kangaskhan
- Orthworm's special defense is not great
- I love Raichu for this fight
- We're definitely done for the night now.

### 2026-01-22
#### Notable Encounters
- Hatched a few eggs, and got Rillaboom, Greninja, Delphox, and Decidueye.
- 
#### Notable Fights
##### Angry Ghost
- Free with Donphan and Gyarados as long as I don't get crit

##### Silph Rival
| **Mine**      | **Counters** |
| ------------- | :----------: |
| Ninetails - A |   Weather    |
| Raichu        |  Staraptor   |
| Meganium      |  Azumarill   |
| Donphan       |   Jumpluff   |
| Bouffalant    |  Charizard   |
| Chesnaught    |  Kingambit   |

- Mostly clean, but a few messy switches. Charizard came straight in after Staraptor, and I didn't manage to get Boufallant in cleanly. I hit a Volt Switch with Raichu, which chipped Charizard too much. When Bouffalant came in, Charizard swapped, which meant I needed to swap again and ended up needing to sack Bouffalant to get Raichu back in safely and KO Charizard. Everything was fine after that. The weather not going up until after Charizard goes Mega really throws me off. 

##### Silph Double
| **Mine**   |   **Counters**    |
| ---------- | :---------------: |
| Jellicent  | Water Spout Spam  |
| Greninja   | Protean/Houndoom  |
| Chesnaught | Dark/Water resist |

- Somehow a deathless win! They went after Masquerain first, so Jellicent got away pretty free. Also got a clutch crit on Primarina. Sending in Greninja allowed me to pivot around a bit and Brenden took out Mawile with Exploud. 
- Overall, a decent strategy, but room for improvement. Not sure how it would have gone if I didn't get that early crit, or if Brenden decided to focus on Goldengho vs Primarina and Mawile. I also got the right baits for when I used Protect, because Archer and Ariana both double hit into Protect (once with Jellicent and the other with Greninja)
- On to Giovanni 2!

##### Giovanni 2
| **Mine**      |  **Counters**   |
| ------------- | :-------------: |
| Jellicent     | Pivot/Hippowdon |
| Chesnaught    |   Kangaskhan    |
| Meganium      |    Garganacl    |
| Donphan       |    Excadrill    |
| Ninetails - A |    Torterra     |
| Walrein       |    Garchomp     |

- Well that went pretty much exactly according to plan. Each counter worked perfectly, and I only had to risk a crit on Ninetails after Torterra Shell Smashed. Granted, if it had rolled the crit, I'm not sure what I would have done. Definitely would have lost multiple mons. But it worked so we roll!

#### Things I learned
- Jellicent is a great lead on Gio 2, and with a little luck, trivializes the Rocket Double. I'm lucky enough to have multiple weather setters and I'm definitely going to have to make use of them. 
- Donphan is great for Excadrill, takes anything after a Swords Dance, and can KO with Bulldoze into Ice Shard.
- Need to work on my counters for Charizard. Bouffalant was disposable, but it would have been nice not to need it. More thought about resetting weather *after* Charizard sets it. Ideally, I need to predictably bait a move, then swap in something that can take it before sending my weather setter. I'll think more on that next time.
- On to Sabrina! Should be pretty free with Water Spout Jellicent in the rain. Just need to remember to send something that can KO Brute Bonnet and KO or Taunt Porygon2.

### 2026-01-23
#### Notable Encounters
- Torkoal on Route 17
- Dhelmise - Sevii hatched in Fuschia


#### Notable Fights
##### Sabrina
| **Mine**   |        **Counters**        |
| ---------- | :------------------------: |
| Jellicent  | Pretty much the whole team |
| Politoed   |            Rain            |
| Cinderace  |        Brute Bonnet        |
| Chesnaught |          Porygon2          |

- I don't even remember what the last 2 mons were. I didn't need them. Jellicent pretty much swept. Politoed swapped to Cinderace on turn 1, so that when Brute Bonnet came out, U-turn immediately killed it while Water Spout KO'd Gardvoir. Went back to Politoed and Scald + Water Spout took out Ursaluna and Porygon. 3 turns, no damage. Textbook for when I have the rain.

##### Cycling Road Back-to-Back-to-Back
- I don't even remember the team. Led with Politoed for the rain, swapped to Dragapult to catch the Fake Out from Mienshao then swept. Similar situation on battle 2, pivot to Dragapult KO. Then the last fight Politoed got a burn from Scald on Turn 1, so Hariyama was useless. Politoed took the rest of that fight.

##### Sand Route Biker 1
| **Mine**   |    **Counters**    |
| ---------- | :----------------: |
| Dragapult  |      Accelgor      |
| Jellicent  |      Gigalith      |
| Swellow    |     Houndstone     |
| Electivire |      Roserade      |
| Politoed   | Weather/Houndstone |
| Meganium   |       Bonus        |

- All according to plan. Dragapult KO's Accelgor, Houndstone comes in, I send out Swellow on the Last Respects, hit a Return, then pivot to Politoed after an Ice Fang. Politoed KO's with Scald, then Roserade comes out. Swap to Electivire and 2 Fire Punches KO. Lastly, Gigalith and Jellicent takes it with a Water Spout.

##### Sand Route Biker 2
| **Mine**   | **Counters** |
| ---------- | :----------: |
| Meganium   |   Swampert   |
| Palossand  |  Revavroom   |
| Incineroar |   Cacturne   |
| Delphox    |    Scizor    |

- All counters worked perfectly. No issues with pivoting either, because Revavroom missed Gunk Shot on the swap, then Cacturne just hit Incineroar with a Needle Arm after Intimidate. U-turned out to Delphox and when Scizor came in, took it out with Flamethrower

##### Sand Route Biker 3
| **Mine**   |        **Counters**         |
| ---------- | :-------------------------: |
| Greninja   |          Stunfisk           |
| Dragapult  |          Beedrill           |
| Meganium   | Greninja/Stunfisk/Dracovish |
| Dragapult  |            Aron             |
| Electivire |          Greninja           |
| Swellow    |          Beedrill           |

- Didn't go quite exactly to plan, because Greninja missed Water Shruiken after Taunting Stunfisk. So after a bunch of swapping, Stunfisk came in on Meganium and got Rocks up. This just meant I couldn't use Swellow for Beedrill, but turns out Dragapult out-speeds and OKHOs anyway. So no harm done. Dragapult also walls Aron, and Electivire cleaned up Greninja. Easy clap.

##### Rain Route 1
| **Mine**      | **Counters** |
| ------------- | :----------: |
| Chesnaught    |  Magnezone   |
| Raichu        |   Starmie    |
| Ninetails - A |  Salamence   |
| Meganium      |   Whiscash   |
| Zebstrika - S |  Salamence   |
| Dragapult     |    Pivot     |

- Trivial. Chesnaught caught an Explosion from Magnezone, then Salamence came out. I swapped to Timid/Wise Glasses Sevii Zebstrika and swept with Ice Beam and Freeze Dry.

##### Rain Route 2
| **Mine**      | **Counters** |
| ------------- | :----------: |
| Raichu        |  Cramorant   |
| Zebstrika - S |   Mantine    |
| Ninetales - A |  Decidueye   |
| Palossand     |  Nidoqueen   |
| Swellow       |  Decidueye   |
| Dragapult     |    Extra     |

- Well Raichu didn't take out the Cramorant, it went Roost instead of Surf on Turn 2, so Raichu got nailed second turn. Just swapped to Ninetales to hit Ice Shard for KO. Mantine came out next and got blasted by Freeze Dry, then Nidoqueen was last. Swapped to Palossand, hit an Earth Power, then flipped to Dragapult to finish.

##### Rain Route 4
- Skipped Dragon Tamer Ramiro, but have to do 2 and 4 back to back. Definitely worth it.

| **Mine**      |     **Counters**      |
| ------------- | :-------------------: |
| Dragapult     | Dragapult/Kilowattrel |
| Meganium      |        Omastar        |
| Walrein       |        Pinsir         |
| Raichu        |         Vibes         |
| Zebstrika - S |         Vibes         |
| Ninetales - A |         Vibes         |

- Dragapult trivializes this fight. Plus the ultimate counter to Shell Smash Omastar: Triage Meganium. Finally Fur Coat Walrein to stonewall Pinsir and Ice Beam to victory.


##### Brenden - Fuschia City
| **Mine**     | **Counters** |
| ------------ | :----------: |
| Delphox      |  Metagross   |
| Meganium     |   Medicham   |
| Donphan      |   Sceptile   |
| Dragapult    |   Exploud    |
| Copperajah    |  Gardevoir   |
| Dhelmise - S |  Crawdawnt   |

- THese counters almost all worked perfectly, except Meganium took out Sceptile and Medicham. It also did Crawdawnt. Copperajah cleaned up Gardevoir, despite me not leveling it up to the right level (it was at 56 instead of 68). Thankfully the elephant has bulk. And a Chople Berry. All in all, about as perfect as could be.

#### What I learned
- This section of this run was extremely clean. I usually lose stuff on either the weather route or Brendan, just from poor planning and being tired. 
- This section doesn't really need weather modification with the box I have here. Stars have been Dragapult (obviously), Meganium (lots of favorable match ups here), Walrein (key physical wall), and Zebstrika of all things. The last two have helpful typing, good speed or bulk and enough power to go 1 v 1 against the right match up.
