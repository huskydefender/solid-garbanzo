# Progress Log

## 2026-01-20
### Notable Encounters
#### Pre-Surge
- Just hatched eggs:
  - Espathra, Bouffalant, and Slowpoke - G
  - Learned I don't need them!
#### Pre-Erika
- Vulpix-Alola on Route 5, big win.
- Chespin from an egg on Route 9! Let's go!
- Frillish in Vermillion!

### Notable Fights

#### Surge
| **Mine**     |     **Counters**     |
| ------------ | :------------------: |
| Clodsire     | Pincurchin/Bellibolt |
| Rapidash - G |   Pawmot/Vikavolt    |
| Donphan      |      Manectric       |
| Meganium     |        Pawmot        |
| Bouffalant   |       Vikavolt       |
| Golisopod    |        Pivot         |

- This was the cleanest Surge I've ever had. Clodsire, Rapidash, Donphan, and Meganium just completely bossed it. Toxic Spikes, then pivot. Vikavolt was the only real stumbling block, but because Rapidash had an Air Balloon and Clodsire was low enough to be knocked out by Mud Shot, it was trivial to pivot to Rapidash and hit two Fire Lashes to KO.
- Manectric was another easy pivot, between Clodsire, Rapidash and Meganium to soak hits and it went down to poison.
- Pawmot came in on Meganium and got 2KO'd by Draining Kiss
- Encounter time!
- Ready to fight Erika


### Things I learned
- Surge is free, can handle it before getting the rest of my encounters. Just need: Clodsire, Donphan, Rapidash-G, and Meganium.

## 2026-01-21
### Notable Fights
#### Erika
| **Mine**     | **Counters**  |
| ------------ | :-----------: |
| Swellow      |   Meganium    |
| Rapidash - G | Grass Resist  |
| Palossand    | Electrode - H |
| Espathra     |   Venusaur    |
| Perrserker   |  Meowscarada  |
| Golisopod    |   Rillaboom   |

- What a disappointment. I didn't calc and Espathra Psychic didn't take out Venusaur. On top of that, it lived a second Psychic on 1 after a Giga Drain. That meant I lost Espathra, and somehow Electrode's Chloroblast killed Golisopod. Really should calc these. I don't know Erika's calcs well enough. 
- I used to be able to bait Electrode, then pivot in to Palossand on Explosion, but I will probably re-think that strategy for future runs. It's just so useless other than pivoting around Electrode. 
- Perrserker is a great Meowscarada counter. Lives two Knock-Offs and kills with Fake Out into Iron Head with Steely Spirit. Even if it doesn't, I kill with Bullet Punch.
- Honestly thinking about resetting after this. Golisopod is just so good. But we carry on.

#### Casino Grunt
| **Mine**    |    **Counters**     |
| ----------- | :-----------------: |
| Basculegion |  Hypno/Aerodactyl   |
| Perrserker  | Aerodactyl/Granbull |
| Electivire  |      Obstagoon      |
| Swellow     |      Granbull       |
| Jellicent   |        Pivot        |
| Rhydon      |        Pivot        |

- A very clean fight. Aqua Jet and Bullet Punch for Aerodactyl, then Basulegion takes out Hypno with Phantom Force (thought it was Spirit Shackle, but it worked out fine). It actually worked better than fine, because I brought in Electivire while Obstagoon Sucker Punched Basculegion on the Phantom Force, and then Granbull came out alone, but couldn't beat Electivire and Perrserker through Fake Out and Bullet Punch.

#### First Rocket Double
| **Mine**      |   **Counters**   |
| ------------- | :--------------: |
| Slowbro - G   |   Weezing - G    |
| Perrserker    | Fake Out/Slaking |
| Electivire    |  Crobat/Slaking  |
| Revavroom     |    Hydrapple     |
| Ninetales - A |    Hydrapple     |
| Basculegion   |      Pivot       |

- My messiest one in a while, but no losses. Slowbro - G doesn't get Protect? And forgot to teach it to my back up mons. Took out Weezing first turn as planned, but had to do a bunch of pivoting because Slowbro didn't have Protect. Thank goodness for Revavroom defense and Basculegion typing.

#### Second Rocket Double
#### Casino Grunt
| **Mine**     |       **Counters**       |
| ------------ | :----------------------: |
| Swellow      |    Shiftry/Toxicroak     |
| Raichu       | Talonflame/Lightning Rod |
| Clodsire     |        Eelektross        |
| Slowbro - G  |        Eelektross        |
| Jellicent    |          Pivot           |
| Rapidash - G |          Pivot           |

- My cleanest ever. Lightning Rod Raichu next to Swellow completely breaks this fight. Swellow takes out Shiftry with Dual Wingbeat while Talonflame is flinched with Fake Out. Then Swellow can take out Talonflame if Eelektross comes in, and on the following turn the Toxicroak. By this point, Eelektross has got a few hits in, so I swap to Slowbro and Clodsire to mop up. 
  
### Things I learned
- Lightning Rod Raichu is great next to Swellow
- I need to calc Erika every time. Can't rely on Palossand for Electrode. 
- Next up Gio 1. I'll take a quick peruse and see if I can find a clean line, but it won't happen today.
