# Progress Log

## 2026-01-20
### Notable Encounters
#### Pre-Surge
- Just hatched eggs:
  - Espathra, Bouffalant, and Slowpoke - G
  - Learned I don't need them!
#### Pre-Erika
- Vulpix-Alola on Route 5, big win.
- Chespin from an egg on Route 9! Let's go!
- Frillish in Vermillion!

### Notable Fights

#### Surge
| **Mine**     |     **Counters**     |
| ------------ | :------------------: |
| Clodsire     | Pincurchin/Bellibolt |
| Rapidash - G |   Pawmot/Vikavolt    |
| Donphan      |      Manectric       |
| Meganium     |        Pawmot        |
| Bouffalant   |       Vikavolt       |
| Golisopod    |        Pivot         |

- This was the cleanest Surge I've ever had. Clodsire, Rapidash, Donphan, and Meganium just completely bossed it. Toxic Spikes, then pivot. Vikavolt was the only real stumbling block, but because Rapidash had an Air Balloon and Clodsire was low enough to be knocked out by Mud Shot, it was trivial to pivot to Rapidash and hit two Fire Lashes to KO.
- Manectric was another easy pivot, between Clodsire, Rapidash and Meganium to soak hits and it went down to poison.
- Pawmot came in on Meganium and got 2KO'd by Draining Kiss
- Encounter time!
- Ready to fight Erika


### Things I learned
- Surge is free, can handle it before getting the rest of my encounters. Just need: Clodsire, Donphan, Rapidash-G, and Meganium.
